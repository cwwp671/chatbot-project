# Chatbot Project

This is a simple text-based chatbot that uses natural language processing techniques to interact with users. The chatbot is built using Python and the `nltk` library for natural language processing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the program using `python -m src.main`.

## Usage

Once the program is running, the chatbot will prompt the user for input. Users can type in any message or question, and the chatbot will attempt to respond in a natural manner.
